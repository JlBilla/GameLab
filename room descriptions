hallway
This is your second floor hallway in your house, it's nice and simple with several doors, south leads you back to your bedroom, east leads you too your storage room, west leads you to your bathroom, and going down the stairs leads to the main hall.
storage
This is your storage room, it's cramped but nice to admire, you have your briefcase for work in here along with an orb on a pedestal that was here when you moved in, going west takes you back to the hallway.
wardrobe
This is your walk-in-wardrobe, despite being so big you don't have a lot of clothes to put in here, maybe this should've been your storage room...oh well. You do notice your favorite coat on a hanger that you can put on before work though. There's also a safe you keep your cherished accessories in, and finally a old timey chest that was also here before you moved in, you haven't found the key for it yet though so it sits collecting dust, going you brush it off though since you want to restore it someday. Going north takes you back into you bedroom.
bathroom
This is your bathroom...that's it, no fancy decor, it's just a simple room that gets the job done. what? expected every room to have something in it to take? Going east leads you back to the hallway.
bedroom
This is your bedroom, it's where you sleep, there's a tv on a tv stand in front of your bed and your computer desk in the corner. you have the key to your house's front door here. Going north leads to the hallway and going south leads to your wardrobe.
main hall
This is the main floor hallway of your house, it is nicely sized, not cramped, not large, the stairs lead you to a general area around the base of the house, but that does matter right now, as your goal, leaving to work through the front door, is right there, you just need to be ready.
